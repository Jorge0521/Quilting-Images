# Quilting-Images
Short Abstract:
I built a program that stiches image patches together that synthesises new texture images using python.
The program finds the shortest path to find a seam where the two images have very similar brightness values to
stitch them together. This process is repeated until the desired height and width image is formed. Program was done for computational photography class.
