# Quilting-Images(Project for Computer Vision Class)
Short Abstract:
I built a program that stiches image patches together that synthesises new texture images using python.
The program finds the shortest path to find a seam where the two images have very similar brightness values to
stitch them together. This process is repeated until the desired height and width image is formed
